                <h3>Design & Development</h3>
                <p>I started learning to code while going to school for Electrical Engineering. I loved it so much that I 
                    continued to learn as much as could until, through both personal and professional projects, I gained 
                    a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.

                <p>Back when Buffalo Wild Wings used to have the Blazing Challenge I used to have fun going to every B-Dubs 
                    near me and winning the challenge to get a cool shirt while eating some delicious wings!
